Value 1: Character,X,Y
Value 2: Duration,Ease
Character is either BF, Dad or GF. This can be skipped.
X and Y can be skipped if you don't want any offsets.
Duration works in Steps. Set it to "0" to be instant.
Ease can be skipped as the default one is "linear".
Leave Value 2 blank if you don't want to use a tween.
Leave Value 1 blank if you want the camera to act
normally again since it'll be locked on the target.
